      <h1>About Jonathan Pincince</h1>
      
      <p>My name is Jonathan Pincince, and I'm currently a junior in the Computer Science
        program at the University of Rhode Island. I'm enjoying computer science because
        it's very engaging for the mind. For physical activities I like to live an
        active lifestyle that includes sports and a job that keeps my on my feet. I also
        love to travel and engage with other cultures and perspectives. <br>
        This page's background is a picture I took recently from the Notre Dame de la Garde
        in Marseille, France. The view looks south onto a residential part of the city,
        with a background of the mountains.</p>

          origina French families who packed up and left France for Quebec. My entire father's side
          of the family is French-Canadian.
