    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Jonathan Pincince, and I'm currently a junior in the Computer Science
      program at the University of Rhode Island. I'm enjoying computer science because
      it's very engaging for the mind. For physical activities I like to live an
      active lifestyle that includes sports and a job that keeps my on my feet. I also
      love to travel and engage with other cultures and perspectives.</p>
