    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Jonathan Pincince, and I'm currently a junior in the Computer Science
      program at the University of Rhode Island. I'm enjoying computer science because
      it's very engaging for the mind. For physical activities I like to live an
      active lifestyle that includes sports and a job that keeps my on my feet. I also
      love to travel and engage with other cultures and perspectives.</p>

    <p>This page's background is a picture I took recently from the Notre Dame de la Garde
      in Marseille, France. The view looks south onto the southern part of the city,
      with a view of some mountains and the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

      <p class="caption">This is me sitting with the family dog, Luna. This picture was
        perfectly timed to capture what happens when she's had enough of me.</p>
